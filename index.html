                <h3> Programming Languages </h3>
                <hr> A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.Most programming
                languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer
                language.

                The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
                semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a
                specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while
                other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some
                languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the
                dominant implementation being common.

                Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design,
                implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.The term
                computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language. However, the usage of
                both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming
                languages as a subset of computer languages. Similarly, languages used in computing that have a
                different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For
                instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are
                not meant to be used for programming. One way of classifying computer languages is by the
                computations they are capable of expressing, as described by the theory of computation. The majority of
                practical programming languages are Turing complete, and all Turing complete languages can implement
                the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing
                complete, yet are often called programming languages. However, some authors restrict the term
                "programming language" to Turing complete languages.

                Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines
                and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware
                resources. John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much
                programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even
                graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the
                fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts
                is the reason for many flaws in input formats.</p>

            <h3> Domain and target </h3>
            <hr>
            In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages
            are usually defined and studied this way. Programming languages differ from natural languages in that
            natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow
            humans to communicate instructions to machines.

            The domain of the language is also worth consideration. Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which
            define structured data, are not usually considered programming languages. Programming languages
            may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if computational semantics is defined. XSLT, for
            example, is a Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax. Moreover, LaTeX, which is
            mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset.

            Abstractions
            Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or
            controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate
            abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle.[20] This principle is sometimes formulated as a
            recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.

            History
            Main article: History of programming languages
            Early developments
            Very early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the help of a stored program, by modifying
            their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.

            Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where the programmer writes each instruction
            in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add the value in two
            memory locations might consist of 3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add" operation, and two memory
            locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards, paper tape, magnetic
            tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer. Machine languages were later termed
            first-generation programming languages (1GL).

            The next step was the development of the so-called second-generation programming languages (2GL) or assembly
            languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer. These
            served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone
            address calculations.
